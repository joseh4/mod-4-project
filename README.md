# Projection of Video Game Sales

### Summary
We will analyze and attempt to understand what factors play a role in the global sales of different video games from 2007-2016. We will look at the different platforms video games are played on, the genre of each game, and rating, to determine their influence on global sales. We will be using a data set from kaggle.com

### Objectives

1. Find any differences between global sales and platforms.
2. find any differneces between global sales and genres.
3. Find any differences between global sales ratings.
4. Run a linear regression model on the variables.

### Conclusion
We need more data to effectively decide what factors play a role in video games sales. We were not able to definitvely say one variable has a greater influence on global sales over another. Some data that could help would be budget for each game, popularity prior to release, marketing budget for each game, and development time.
